Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task of enhancing the interface and fixing the wallet connection issues:

### Information Gathered:
- The current `index.html` file contains sections for wallet connection, NFT collection, and transaction history.
- The wallet connection logic needs to be verified and synchronized across all pages.
- The user interface can be improved for better usability and aesthetics.

### Plan:
1. **Enhance Wallet Connection Logic:**
   - Ensure that the wallet connection function (`connectWallet()`) is properly implemented and called on page load.
   - Add checks to ensure the wallet is connected before allowing users to interact with other features.

2. **Improve User Interface:**
   - Update the layout and styling of the wallet connection button and balance display for better visibility.
   - Ensure that the NFT collection and transaction history sections are visually appealing and user-friendly.

3. **Synchronization Across Pages:**
   - Implement a mechanism to ensure that the wallet state is synchronized across all pages (e.g., using local storage or a global state management approach).

### Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `walletconnect.js`: This file may need updates to ensure proper wallet connection handling.
- `cisp-wallet.js`: Ensure that wallet creation and management functions are working correctly.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Test the wallet connection and creation functionality across different pages.
- Verify that the UI changes are visually appealing and functional.
- Ensure that all features work seamlessly after the modifications.
