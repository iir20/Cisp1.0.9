# Cosmic Space Protocol (CISP)

A Web3 application with a built-in blockchain implementation, native wallet system, mining platform, and NFT marketplace.

## Overview

Cosmic Space Protocol is a complete Web3 ecosystem that demonstrates the core concepts of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and NFTs. The application includes:

- **CISP Blockchain**: A lightweight blockchain implementation with Proof of Work (PoW) consensus
- **Native Wallet System**: Create and manage wallets directly in the application
- **Mining Platform**: Mine xCIS coins using your CPU power
- **NFT System**: Generate, collect, and view unique NFTs
- **Conversion System**: Convert xCIS to CIS tokens

## Features

### Blockchain Implementation

- Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Transaction validation and signing
- Block mining with rewards
- Support for different transaction types (Transfer, Mint, Reward, NFT)

### Wallet System

- Create multiple wallets with password protection
- Secure key generation and storage
- Transaction signing and verification
- Balance tracking for xCIS and CIS tokens
- Welcome bonus for new wallets

### Mining System

- Real CPU-based mining using Web Workers
- Mining power upgrades
- Visual mining effects and animations
- Mining rewards directly to your wallet
- Mining statistics tracking

### NFT System

- Random NFT generation with different types and rarities
- NFT minting on the blockchain
- NFT gallery with filtering options
- Detailed NFT information display
- Welcome NFT for new wallets

### User Interface

- Modern, responsive design
- Interactive animations and effects
- Real-time blockchain visualization
- Transaction history display
- Balance tracking across all pages

## Getting Started

1. Open the application in a web browser
2. Click "Connect Wallet" to create a new wallet or log in to an existing one
3. Navigate through the different sections using the menu
4. Start mining to earn xCIS coins
5. Generate NFTs using your earned coins
6. Convert xCIS to CIS as needed

## Technical Details

The application is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with no external dependencies. It includes:

- A custom blockchain implementation in JavaScript
- Web Workers for parallel mining operations
- LocalStorage for persistent data storage
- CSS animations and transitions for visual effects
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Security Notes

This is a demonstration project and not intended for production use. The cryptographic implementations are simplified for educational purposes. In a real-world application, you would use:

- Proper cryptographic libraries for key generation and signing
- Secure storage solutions for private keys
- A distributed network of nodes for consensus
- Smart contract capabilities for complex operations
